#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Streams that arrive as rows. One row is one Stream: the last column of
//! a configured query is what Xmip carries, the first column is where it
//! came from.
//!
//! `MariaDB` is a database the estate's Parties already have, and its
//! protocol also reaches the MySQL servers they have. A table in one is
//! the oldest integration surface there is: a producer inserts, an
//! integrator polls. A Receive Location runs its
//! query — `SELECT id, payload FROM inbox ORDER BY id` unless told
//! otherwise — and hands each row up; a Send Location inserts the Stream
//! as one column of one row. What the column holds is the Location's to
//! declare, never the bytes' (ADR-0038): `column = "binary"`, the default,
//! inserts every Stream as an `X'…'` hexadecimal literal and reads a value
//! back from a hex form (`MariaDB`'s, `xmip-core-library-sql`); `column = "text"` decodes the Stream
//! strictly in its `encoding` — `utf-8` unless another Unicode form is
//! named — inserts it as a string literal, and encodes a value read back
//! to that form. A Stream that is not its declared form is refused, never
//! repaired; so is a row value that is not UTF-8. What is spoken is
//! the client/server protocol as every client since 4.1 speaks it, on
//! port 3306: the greeting, a response with the password scrambled the
//! native password way (`handshake.rs`, SHA-1 from codec),
//! `COM_QUERY` with rows as text (`result.rs`), `COM_QUIT`.
//! `caching_sha2_password` is not implemented and a server that asks for
//! it is told so; TLS is `xmip-core-library-tls`'s, per ADR-0033.
//!
//! Rows are artefacts and this transport claims none of them, per ADR-0024:
//! the atomic claim a database has, `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, only
//! holds inside a transaction, and the flow here opens and closes its
//! connection inside one receive, so there is no transaction to hold it
//! across the Stream's lifetime. Until the claim is written, a Receive
//! Location is one consumer of its query, and the query itself — a status
//! column, a `DELETE … RETURNING` on `MariaDB` — is what keeps a row from
//! arriving twice.
//!
//! **A row is consumed by the `accept` statement, after its cycle.** The query
//! only reads. Where the Location declares `accept` — `DELETE FROM inbox WHERE
//! id = ?` — it runs once a row's cycle accepted it, the row's name bound in
//! place of `?` (`transport::sql::accept`), written as `MariaDB`'s string
//! literal. A refused row is left where it lies, and not received again
//! while its body is unchanged. A row whose cycle failed is left, and the next
//! receive reads it again; so is a row whose name is NULL, which no statement
//! can name. Where `accept` is left out a row's verdict tells the database
//! nothing: every row is read again unless the query keeps it from that. A
//! query that consumes as it reads — a `DELETE … RETURNING` on `MariaDB` —
//! consumes before the receive cycle has run, so acceptance is at-most-once
//! under such a query.
//!
//! The origin URI carries what the row knew: `mariadb://server/orders?row=41`.
//! A send target is `mariadb://host:3306/<database>/<table>/<column>`,
//! `host:3306/<database>/<table>/<column>`, or `<table>/<column>` on the
//! configured server and database.
